    "In this notebook, we're going to use Python to create a deep learning model that can take images of faces and output the emotion being expressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we're going to use is the FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 grayscale images of faces. Each image is 48x48 pixels and is labeled with one of seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, or neutral. The dataset and more information can be found [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** One issue with the dataset is that it has relatively few images in the disgust category, so we drop that category for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build our model, we'll use the Keras deep learning library, which provides a high-level interface for building and training neural networks. We'll start by loading the dataset and exploring the images, then we'll build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the emotions in the images.\n",
