## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives Covered

### **Week 1: Python Fundamentals**
- Variables, constants, and data structures
- Functions and modular programming
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Game loops and event handling
- File I/O and resource management

### **Week 2: AI Integration**
- Machine learning basics
- Computer vision concepts
- API integration and web requests
- Natural language processing
- Threading and asynchronous programming

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
- **Missing files**: All teaching materials are in this `/instruction` folder
- **Game won't run**: Make sure you're in the parent directory when running `python main.py`
- **Dependencies**: The game auto-installs required packages via `installer.py`

### **Getting Help:**
1. Check the troubleshooting sections in `TEACHING_GUIDE.md`
2. Review the file documentation for specific technical issues
3. Use the diagram generators to create visual aids

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

Students should progress from basic Python syntax to building their own AI-enhanced game features. The materials support differentiated instruction for various skill levels:

- **ðŸ”° Beginners**: Start with simple modifications to settings and constants
- **ðŸ”¸ Intermediate**: Create new game objects and mechanics
- **ðŸ”¶ Advanced**: Build complex systems and AI integrations
- **ðŸš€ Expert**: Contribute new features and optimizations
