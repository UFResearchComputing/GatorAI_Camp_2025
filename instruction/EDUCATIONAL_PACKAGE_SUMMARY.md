## üéì **Educational Philosophy**

This package embodies several key educational principles:

### **Learning by Doing**
Students don't just read about programming concepts‚Äîthey see them working in a real, interactive game that responds to their changes.

### **Scaffolded Complexity**
The progression from simple constants to complex AI systems allows students to build confidence while tackling increasingly sophisticated challenges.

### **Real-World Relevance**
Every programming concept taught has direct applications in game development, web development, data science, and AI‚Äîfields students actually care about.

### **Immediate Feedback**
Visual and interactive feedback helps students understand the consequences of their code changes immediately.

### **Social Learning**
The game provides natural opportunities for students to share discoveries, help each other debug, and collaborate on improvements.
